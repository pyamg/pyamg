# What is AMG?

 AMG is a multilevel technique for solving large-scale linear systems with optimal or near-optimal efficiency.  Unlike geometric multigrid, AMG requires little or no geometric information about the underlying problem and develops a sequence of coarser grids directly from the input matrix.  This feature is especially important for problems discretized on unstructured meshes and irregular grids.

# PyAMG Features

PyAMG features implementations of:

- **Ruge-Stuben (RS)** or *Classical AMG*
- AMG based on **Smoothed Aggregation (SA)**

and experimental support for:

- **Adaptive Smoothed Aggregation (Î±SA)**
- **Compatible Relaxation (CR)**

The predominant portion of PyAMG is written in Python with a smaller amount of supporting C++ code for performance critical operations.

# PyAMG Objectives

**ease of use**

- interface is accessible to non-experts
- extensive documentation and references

**speed**

- solves problems with millions of unknowns efficiently
- core multigrid algorithms are implemented in C++ and translated through SWIG
- sparse matrix support provided by scipy.sparse

**readability**

- source code is organized into intuitive components

**extensibility**

- core components can be reused to implement additional techniques
- new features are easy integrated

**experimentation**

- facilitates rapid prototyping and analysis of multigrid methods

**portability**

- tested on several platforms
- relies only on Python, NumPy, and SciPy

# Example Usage

PyAMG is easy to use!  The following code constructs a two-dimensional Poisson problem and solves the resulting linear system with Classical AMG.

````python
from scipy import *
from scipy.linalg import *
from pyamg import *
from pyamg.gallery import *
A = poisson((500,500), format='csr')     # 2D Poisson problem on 500x500 grid
ml = ruge_stuben_solver(A)               # construct the multigrid hierarchy
print ml                                 # print hierarchy information
b = rand(A.shape[0])                     # pick a random right hand side
x = ml.solve(b, tol=1e-10)               # solve Ax=b to a tolerance of 1e-8
print "residual norm is", norm(b - A*x)  # compute norm of residual vector
````
