# Installation
PyAMG requires `numpy` and `scipy`

```
pip install pyamg
```

or from source:

```
pip install .
```

(`python setup.py install` will no longer work)

or with conda (see details below)

```
conda config --add channels conda-forge
conda install pyamg
```

# Introduction

PyAMG is a library of **Algebraic Multigrid (AMG)** solvers with a convenient Python interface.

# Getting Help

- For documentation see [http://pyamg.readthedocs.io/en/latest/](http://pyamg.readthedocs.io/en/latest/).

- Create an [issue](https://github.com/pyamg/pyamg/issues).

- Look at the [Tutorial](https://github.com/pyamg/pyamg/wiki/Tutorial) or the [examples](https://github.com/pyamg/pyamg-examples) (for instance  the [0_start_here](https://github.com/pyamg/pyamg-examples/blob/main/0_start_here/demo.py) example).

- Run the unit tests (`pip install pytest`):
  - With PyAMG installed and from a non-source directory:
  ```python
  import pyamg
  pyamg.test()
  ```
  - From the PyAMG source directory and installed (e.g. with `pip install -e .`):
  ```python
  pytest .
  ```

# What is AMG?

 AMG is a multilevel technique for solving large-scale linear systems with optimal or near-optimal efficiency.  Unlike geometric multigrid, AMG requires little or no geometric information about the underlying problem and develops a sequence of coarser grids directly from the input matrix.  This feature is especially important for problems discretized on unstructured meshes and irregular grids.

# PyAMG Features

PyAMG features implementations of:

- **Ruge-Stuben (RS)** or *Classical AMG*
- AMG based on **Smoothed Aggregation (SA)**

and experimental support for:

- **Adaptive Smoothed Aggregation (Î±SA)**
- **Compatible Relaxation (CR)**

The predominant portion of PyAMG is written in Python with a smaller amount of supporting C++ code for performance critical operations.

# Example Usage

PyAMG is easy to use!  The following code constructs a two-dimensional Poisson problem and solves the resulting linear system with Classical AMG.

````python
import pyamg
import numpy as np
A = pyamg.gallery.poisson((500,500), format='csr')  # 2D Poisson problem on 500x500 grid
ml = pyamg.ruge_stuben_solver(A)                    # construct the multigrid hierarchy
print(ml)                                           # print hierarchy information
b = np.random.rand(A.shape[0])                      # pick a random right hand side
x = ml.solve(b, tol=1e-10)                          # solve Ax=b to a tolerance of 1e-10
print("residual: ", np.linalg.norm(b-A*x))          # compute norm of residual vector
````
